# Brisk
If you are boring just run Brisk. He will say hello to you every five second for 1 minute !

```
 docker run -it --rm --name my-brisk ysinjab/brisk
 ```

And if you are curious to see what is inside him just feel free to run:

```
 docker run -it --rm --name my-brisk ysinjab/brisk /bin/sh
 ```
